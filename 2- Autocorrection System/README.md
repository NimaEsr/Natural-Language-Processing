# Autocorrection system

In this notebook, we will build an autocorrection system from scratch. 

Have your ever misspelled a word in a text message or email? Humans are surely error-prone! With the help of an autocorrection system, those mistakes are automagically corrected!

There are multiple ways to build an autocorrection system. In this notebook, we will do so in several steps detailed below:

- Get a word count given a corpus
- Get a word probability in the corpus 
- Manipulate strings 
- Filter strings 
- Implement Minimum edit distance to compare strings and to help find the optimal path for the edits.
